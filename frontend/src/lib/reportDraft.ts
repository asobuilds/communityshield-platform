/**
 * The report wizard's draft: what survives a reload, and what does not.
 *
 * Whoever is filling this in is often mid-incident, on a phone, on a flaky
 * connection, and this is the longest form in the product. Losing it to a mistap
 * or a backgrounded tab is the difference between a report filed and a report
 * abandoned, so it is written to `localStorage` as it is typed.
 *
 * Three deliberate exclusions:
 *
 *  - **The step index is not stored.** A restored draft reopens at step 1.
 *    Persisting it would let an emptied draft resume on "Review", presenting a
 *    summary of nothing as if it were ready to send.
 *  - **A draft is not a report.** It has no tracking id and no unit has seen it.
 *    Nothing here is an offline submission queue — that is a real feature with
 *    real semantics (ordering, retry, dedupe) and this is not it. The UI must
 *    never let a saved draft read as "sent".
 *  - **No evidence files, only links.** There is no binary upload endpoint; a
 *    draft holds the same hosted URLs the eventual `POST /evidence/upload` gets.
 *
 * The storage functions take a `Storage`-shaped object rather than reaching for
 * the global, because that is the only way to exercise them in a node test — this
 * repo has no DOM environment. `reportDraftStorage()` is the one place that
 * touches the real thing.
